Hey, I smoked some weed. Now when you smoke weed, the funniest thing you can do is to forget everything, let the brain work free and observe the thought process.

So I was doing that. Trying to solve that 3rd problem mentally on my way back from lunch. I met a guy named Sushovan on the way. The guy was walking with a bunch of papers that looked like a thesis. So I thought he must have finished his thesis.

Then I asked him in passing that when did he finish writing his thesis... He looked confused.

Now I got confused about why he got confused. The question was pretty clear, involving the time when he finished his project thesis. Why did he look confused !!!

Then I thought maybe I'm so high that I didn't frame the question in an audible way and like always I haven't really asked him and it was just a passing thought. So I had to smile to me about this silliness.

But then I realised that Sushovan is dual degree guy and unlike us he hasn't got a research project paper. So basically he wasn't writing a thesis at all.

That was seriously funny, the way my thinking works. I'm still laughing inside my head. It's ironic. No idea wtf is wrong with me. Why would I think such bullshit ? Could have thought better things... Better things like what !!!  I think thinking funny things is not bullshiting.

Even now my head is a bit dizzy. I'm still thinking too much. So what was I originally thinking before I got diverted by the appearance of Sushovan ? But wait.. Where did you come in ?? Now I remember, I thought of sharing that funny thought process with way. But why on earth am I writing my own free thoughts down here !!! I must be that high. But why am I troubling this certain young lady, my Highness ??? Shit I'm so high that I'm calling myself Highness. That fits. That's funny. Anyway, that's not the point, I'm still troubling. I'm still writing down my thoughts.

But now I observe, my thoughts are more like conversation... I am talking to somebody, maybe I'm talking to myself only. So who is this writing addressed to !!! You readers, it's addressed to you.

When did I decide to make it a literary piece that I'm addressing it to readers ??? I'm talking to you. Writing to you, I think I am in love with you. But who are you really ! I'm still not sure if you're an imagination or not. We had talked about that before. Maybe if I'm thinking about making it a literary piece I should rather not put your existence to reality. You are a kind, good lady and I shouldn't write publicly about writing to you, though I intend you to be the primary reader. It's gonna be funny anyway. I'm thinking funny.

You know what the best thing about writing your thoughts is that you can go though them later and observe later... Should start a thought diary maybe. Somehow, I'm still diverted. What was I originally thinking about ! Shouldn't trouble this young lady. Yeah that was what I thought when I got diverted again. I called myself Highness and thought it was funny. But original point was about not troubling the lady. But if I do, what happens of you, o readers ?

I must continue thinking. Because some of you readers might find it funny. Actually it's all bullshit, I'm not really talking any serious point. No philosophy. I'm not even making logical statements backed by facts. So readers, rather try and see how human thinking works when let free.

Well, it probably doesn't work when it's let free. It needs a topic, some subject to focus it's thoughts on. So basically I'm saying that the objects of thought are as important as the thoughts themselves. Because no object means no thought ! Now that's interesting, I didn't consciously decide to think about philosophical things like whether the object of thought or the thought itself are closer to contextual reality ? Then the thoughts themselves generated the object of thought here, in this case the object of thought is an abstract concept of a philosophical problem !

So, that makes one thing observable, that human mind is capable of thinking on a free, non constrained manner without being guided consciously by itself. Maybe this is deeper layer of human mind. Which doesn't need any conscious effort for thinking anything. Hence this state of the thought process might be the layer that generates strands of thought which we accept or reject consciously.

But definitely we can think without any conscious effort. Thinking is like breathing. Just like we die when we stop breathing, we die when we stop thinking. This statement above gives rise to two questions... Whether such a death caused by inability to think be an intellectual death or a physical death ? And secondly if we die when we stop to think, then is death similar to sleep, be it in an intellectual death or a physical death ? And can we consciously stop thinking ? Certainly not. That's contradictory. If we consciously stopped thinking then from where did the consciousness come ? If there is consciousness there would be thoughts.

This is getting rather complex. And apparently writing the whole thing to a lady. The lady really. But readers, you should know that if you're writing to your lady, you should keep it concise and well justified. You don't want to bore or anger your lady, that's a mortal sin. So try not to follow my example here.

How long have I been thinking like that ? 1 hour !!!! 1 hour of free thought is enough. More is injurious to health. Getting back to work. And, my lady, try not be angry about it. You can publish it for me. And tell your friends to see how funny and stupid a guy can be.

The guy who smoked weed, is signing out. And yeah, I was originally thinking about the 3rd problem, I think I have got it solved mentally before I got diverted. Let's discover that. Now I gotta find that solution thought piece somewhere inside my mind. see you guys.

Let's caption it, "60 minutes of craziness" or should it be "an masterpiece on wasting time pointlessly"... maybe "just some absurd things".
