And really<br/> Words were luxuries, wrongfully<br/> Labeled as necessities  </p>\n\n<p> Freedom who, freedom where<br/> Freedom when, he couldn&#39;t go<br/> Home, which home was it really !!<br/> He didn&#39;t say, he smiled sad  </p>\n\n<p> This is your place, this is where<br/> You belong, they always said<br/> He never used words, he never<br/> Raised his voice, he only smiled sad  </p>\n\n<p> Borders and limits and words<br/> Feelings, cultures and Nations<br/> Gods, god-men, fears and societies<br/> Freedom from whom ? Freedom when ?  </p>\n\n<p> The home was long lost among<br/> Those borders drawn and the earth<br/> Divided, for whom ?? His earth, his love<br/> His birthright. He never said a word.  </p>\n\n<p> Kisses were perversely preferable than wars<br/> He made love to the earth in a very profane way<br/> Across the borders of the living and the dead<br/> Though he got murdered, did the pantomimist die !!!</p>"
