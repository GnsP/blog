Yesterday, on 5th of May 2016, BuzzFeed published an article named '[The Urban Poor You Haven’t Noticed: Millennials Who’re Broke, Hungry, But On Trend](https://www.buzzfeed.com/gayatrijayaraman/broke-hungry-and-on-trend)'. This article talked of trendy twentysomething youths who are literally starving while running a race of showing-off how expensive their lifestyles are. These young people tend to spend a significant portion of their salaries in cheese-burgers, fancy clothings for parties and fancy drinks and stuff like that and towards the end of every month starve because they become too broke even to buy a loaf of bread or a plate of rice (fitting their lifestyles of course). They are 'recently' termed the 'urban poor'.
